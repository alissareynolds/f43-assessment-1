*/

//CODE HERE

let gitAddDefinition = "Git add is a command that stages which files you want to put in the next 'snapshot' of your repository."





//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*

It then sets it up so you can push the information into an exsiting repository with a message using the next command. Once you git commit something it is nearly erasable, therefore you need to be careful what things you commit to a repository."


let gitCommitCode = "git commit -m 'initial commit' "

//console.log(gitCommitCode);

//////////////////PROBLEM 8////////////////////
