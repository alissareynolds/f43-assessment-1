// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/



// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The analysis of requirements is the step after planning where you decide what your software needs to do. It helps define, document, and manage the expectations of the clinets or customers for a software application. Examples of this stage would be deciding what requirements are needed for the project, such as creating a login or signout button for a website."

const design = "Design is a crucial step in the software development process. It involves making the decisons on how to implement the requirements, such as choosing coding languages, hosting services, visual design, user inferface decisions, and the overall structure of the code."

const implementation = "Implementation is the step where you actually code and carry out the designs for a project."

const testingAndIntegration = "In this step you carry out the final testing to make sure everything works properly. You then integrate it to make sure the customers and users can use the software as well. In this stage you also test for bugs and errors, and then put the system into production."

const maintain = "In this stage you maintain the software over time to make sure it continues to work properly. You may add new features or updates as time goes on to keep the software up to date. You may also be checking for bugs or correcting potential security issues that may arise."
